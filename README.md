# Submissions

Submissions is a full stack web application for assignment submission and grading, inspired by the Tutors Open Source Project.

Educators can set up assignments with assessment information, rubrics, marking schemes and due dates. Students complete their assignments online with file uploads, form completion, and links to external resources. Educators can then mark these assignments, providing grades and feedback for the students to view.

Submissions is designed to work alongside the Tutors Open Source Project or any other learning environment, whether online or classroom-based.
